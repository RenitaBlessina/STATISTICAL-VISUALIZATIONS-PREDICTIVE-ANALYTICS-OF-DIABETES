# STATISTICAL-VISUALIZATIONS-PREDICTIVE-ANALYTICS-OF-DIABETES
The Diabetes dataset is being statistically analyzed and visualized to infer relationships between variables and find correlations. The dataset has then been trained using various machine learning algorithms and the best model is chosen. An interactive interface was developed using Python to predict whether a patient had diabetes or not.
